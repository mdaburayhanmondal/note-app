# 📝 Note App

A modern, responsive notes management application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS v4**. This project was developed to master fundamental React concepts including state management, form handling, and component architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **Controlled Form Components**: Uses a single `formData` object and a dynamic `handleChange` function to manage all user inputs efficiently.
- **Collapsible Interface**: A clean UI that allows users to toggle the visibility of the "Add Note" form.
- **Global State Management**: Notes are managed at the app level and passed down via props, demonstrating "Lifting State Up".
- **Priority Color-Coding**: Notes are dynamically styled with color-coded borders based on their priority level (Critical, Important, or Casual).
- **Reusable UI Components**: Features a modular architecture with reusable `TextInput`, `SelectInput`, and `TextAreaInput` components.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Create and Delete notes with instant UI updates using immutable state patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **Lucide React / Emojis** for intuitive visual cues
